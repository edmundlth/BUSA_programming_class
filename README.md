Tutoring materials for Python programming course in Melbourne Business School


# IMPORTANT CAVEAT!!!
These are meant to be discussion questions for programming workshops. They are not meant to be read without the verbal context. There are errors, sometimes deliberate errors and oversimplifications! 

If you're a student of the workshop reading this for review / revision, please consider the possibility that the lecture slides, looking up these topics in a book or on the internet might be better.
