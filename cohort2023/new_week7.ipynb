    "## Definition of $f(n) = O(g(n))$. \n",
    "Given two functions $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, and $g: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, we say $f(n) = O(g(n))$ if **there exist** a (strictly!) positive constant $C > 0$ and $N > 0$ such that whenever $n > N$, we have $f(n) \\leq C g(n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Translating the math talk: We say \"$f(n)$ is of order at most $g(n)$\", when after some cutoff point $N$, $f(n)$ is always smaller than some constant $C$ times $g(n)$. The \"there exist\" in the definition is significant, it signifies that we just need to find some $C$ and $N$ that works, their exact values does not matter and there might be many that works. This allows us to talk about \"large-$n$\" behaviour of a function $f(n)$, we want to know how $f$ behaves when $n$ is \"large enough\" (when it exceeds $N$).\n",

    "You might frequently hear people talking about the \"order\" of function, and that can be make precise by the definition above. Let's find the \"order\" of the following functions: \n",
    "  - $f_1(n) = n - 10000000$: ans $O(n)$\n",
    "  - $n / (n + 1)$: $O(1)$\n",
    "  - $n^2 / (n + 1)$: $O(n)$\n",
    "  - $n^a / (n^b + 1)$: $O(n^{a - b})$\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we will show below, if something is order $n$, it is also order $n^2$. In fact, $f(n) = O(n^{1013415})$ and $f(n) = O(n^3)$ and $f(n) = O(2^n)$. When people talk about \"order\", the usually mean the \"smallest\" function you can compare the given function to and still retain the **inequality** in the definition above for large enough $n$. (Technically, we are asking for **both** $f(n) = O(g(n))$ **and** $g(n) = O(f(n))$). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a sort of \"scale\" that people use to compare functions. If you like, you should check that any function $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ whenever $g$ is higher up on the scaler (need not be next to each other. This is sometimes called the \"Order hierarchy\"\n",

    " * there exist some positive constants $C', N' > 0$ such that when $n > N'$, $g(n) \\leq C'$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: \"there exist\" here means we can now use these variables, they are now in our \"namespace\" so to speak.)\n",
    "And our goal is to show $f(n) + g(n) = O(1)$.  \n",
    "That is to show there exist positive constants $C'', N'' > 0$ such that when $n > N''$, $f(n) + g(n) \\leq C''$.  \n",
